Sound Design and Composition for Trio Z, a solo work by performer Luqui Lagomarsino.



Taking TRIO A by Yvonne Rainner (1966) as a starting point, Luqui Lagomarsino uses something she said, “the mind is a muscle,” as a trigger for the work. From these beginnings, the piece opens up possible utopias within the space that today is occupied by dance, proposing a historical revision that pits the imaginary against the conceptual. Working with the literalness of certain things raises the possibility of collapse and the need for improvisation
Breaking the binarisms between concept and fantasy, the piece has been created through a process in which tarot cards, queer phenomenology, Argentine cumbia, cheesy romanticism, and more have come together.
