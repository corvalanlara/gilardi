Sound Design and Composition for Haunting Current, by Anna Tamm.



Haunting Current connects Baltic living and dead labor with Dutch prosperity, following the example of the timber trade. This extraction of resources spans centuries and the use of Baltic timber has changed over time based on consumer needs: from VOC ships’ hulls and “Dutch Golden Age” painters’ wood panels to its current form—biofuel for energy production. What if electricity—the silent driver of our everyday lives hosts entities from a distant ecosystem?
