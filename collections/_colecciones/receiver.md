ReceiverÂ is a sound piece for two transducers on steel plates. The material qualities of the metal affect the audio signal, feeding back into the composition, mutating and changing it. Like an antenna, this self standing emitter is itself a recipient, broadcasting a network of interdependencies on the rooftop terrace.
